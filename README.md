# Feature Matching with RANSAC

This project provides a Python-based tool for feature matching between two images, integrating Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for feature detection and description, and Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) for robust homography estimation. It supports Region of Interest (ROI) selection and inlier-outlier classification with visualizations, enabling comprehensive analysis of feature correspondences.

## Features

    •    SIFT Feature Detection: Detects and computes scale and rotation-invariant keypoints and descriptors within selected ROIs.
    •    Feature Matching: Matches features between two sets of descriptors using FLANN-based nearest neighbor search with Lowe’s ratio test for robustness.
    •    RANSAC Homography: Estimates a homography matrix while minimizing the effect of outliers, classifying matched points as inliers or outliers.
    •    ROI Selection: Allows interactive selection of regions in images for focused feature detection and matching.
    •    Visualization: Displays inliers and outliers on the second image to facilitate detailed visual analysis.

## Scientific Background

Feature matching is a cornerstone of computer vision, crucial for tasks such as object recognition, image stitching, and 3D reconstruction. This project applies SIFT, a robust algorithm for detecting and describing local features, which remains invariant to scale and rotation. Using RANSAC, the method estimates a homography matrix to align points, handling outliers effectively by iteratively refining the transformation model.

This approach is particularly valuable for real-world scenarios where noise, occlusion, and perspective distortions can degrade matching accuracy.

## Workflow

    1.    Image Input:
    •    Load two images as input for feature matching.
    
    2.    Region of Interest (ROI):
    •    Select regions of interest interactively on both images to focus on relevant areas.
    
    3.    Feature Detection:
    •    Use SIFT to extract local features and their descriptors from the selected ROIs.
    
    4.    Feature Matching:
    •    Match descriptors using FLANN-based nearest neighbor search with Lowe’s ratio test to filter unreliable matches.
    
    5.    Homography Estimation and Classification:
    •    Estimate a robust homography matrix using RANSAC, classifying matches as:
    •    Inliers: Matches consistent with the homography model.
    •    Outliers: Matches rejected by RANSAC.
    
    6.    Visualization:
    •    Draw and display the matched points (inliers and outliers) on the second image, with inliers shown in blue and outliers in red.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
    •    Python 3.8+
    •    Libraries:
    •    opencv-python
    •    numpy
    •    matplotlib
    
## Example Output

    •    Inliers: Points successfully matched and aligned with the homography matrix (blue).
    •    Outliers: Points rejected by RANSAC as inconsistent with the homography model (red).

## Visualization Example:

    •    Input Images: im0.png and im1.png
    •    Output: Image with visualized inliers and outliers.

## Limitations and Future Work

    •    Sensitivity to ROI Selection: ROI selection significantly affects feature detection and matching accuracy.
    •    Large Perspective Distortions: While RANSAC mitigates outliers, extreme distortions can still degrade homography estimation.
    •    Integration with Other Matchers: The framework can be extended to support alternative feature detectors and matchers, such as ORB or AKAZE.
